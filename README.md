## What get?
Realm is a modloader for Rain World that lets you reload mods without closing the game. For users, this means slightly less annoying troubleshooting and file management. For developers, this means you can test features in a rapidfire manner.

Right now, Realm only loads mods; there's no in-game browser yet. Autoupdating is not supported yet, but is planned.

To add mods, just drop them in the `Rain World/BepInEx/plugins` folder like usual. Realm will handle the rest.
