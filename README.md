## What is it?
Realm is an in-game modloader for [Rain World](https://rainworldgame.com/) that lets you reload mods without closing the game. It aims for ease-of-use and rapid mod development.

To install a mod, download its files (which can be folders, `.zip` files, or `.dll` files) and put them in the plugins folder. You can find the plugins folder through the mod menu in-game.
