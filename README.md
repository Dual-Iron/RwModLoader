## What is it?
Realm is an in-game modloader for [Rain World](https://rainworldgame.com/) that lets you reload mods without closing the game. It aims to promote ease of use and rapid mod development.

Install mods by putting .dll files in the "plugins" folder, found in the mod menu. The mod menu is on the title screen.
