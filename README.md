## What get?
Realm is a modloader for Rain World that lets you reload mods without closing the game. For users, this means less troubleshooting. For developers, this means you can test features rapidly.

To add mods, just drop them in the `Rain World/BepInEx/plugins` folder like usual. Realm will handle the rest.

## Where get?
Some important information before you install Realm:
- Realm frequently deletes the BepInEx folder. Move valuable files out of there.
- While Realm can auto-update itself, it doesn't support AutoUpdate for mods yet. That's coming soonâ„¢.
- Don't use Realm and BlepOutIn (BOI) at the same time.

To install Realm, go to the [releases](https://github.com/Dual-Iron/RwModLoader/releases/latest) page.
