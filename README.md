# Realm
Installing [Rain World](https://rainworldgame.com/) mods can be a pain, so Realm is my attempt at simplifying the process. It's easy to use for players and developers alike.

To compare Realm with other similar projects:
- [BOI](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/BOI) manages mods for Rain World. If you can't use Realm, BOI is a reliable fallback.
- [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) loads mods for Unity games. Realm uses BepInEx as a framework to bootstrap the vanilla game.
- [Partiality](https://github.com/PartialityModding) loads mods for Rain World and a few other games. It's slowly being replaced by BepInEx, though.

Realm loads and manages your mods in-game, so you can manage mods **without closing the game**. It's a minor miracle this works at all, and there are [a few](#7) mods it breaks. If a mod doesn't work after reloading in-game, restart and avoid reloading while that mod is installed.

There's a **mod browser** to make installing mods easier. You can still install them manually though: Drop the mod's files and dependencies into the plugins folder as one `.zip` file, `.dll` file, or folder. You can find the plugins folder within the mod menu.[<sup>?</sup>](.github/SUPPORT.md)

## Install Realm
While Realm is installed, keep in mind:
- You don't need to install AutoUpdate, EnumExtender, PublicityStunt, or LogFix.
- You don't need to use BOI. In fact, you shouldn'tâ€”just launch the game without it.
- Logs are sent to `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`.

Click [here](https://github.com/Dual-Iron/RwModLoader/releases/latest) to install.

## Uninstall Realm
1. Open the Rain World folder[<sup>?</sup>](https://savelocation.net/steam-game-folder).
2. Run `uninstall_realm.bat` while the game is closed.

## Resources
