## What is it?
Realm is an in-game modloader for [Rain World](https://rainworldgame.com/) that lets you reload mods without closing the game. For users, this means less troubleshooting. For developers, this means you can test features rapidly.

The mod menu can be found on the title screen. To add mods, drop them in the plugins folder and refresh.

## How do I install it?
Some important information before you install Realm:
- Realm frequently deletes the BepInEx folder. Move valuable files out of there.
- Realm doesn't support AutoUpdate for mods yet. That's coming soonâ„¢.
- Don't use BlepOutIn (BOI) after you've installed Realm.

To install Realm, go to the [releases](https://github.com/Dual-Iron/RwModLoader/releases/latest) page.
