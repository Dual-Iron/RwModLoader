## How do I install mods?
Explained in the [readme](README.md).

Just make sure that all your mod's files, including all its dependencies, are included in one file/folder. Then, put that in the plugins folder.

## How do I uninstall mods?
- For plugins, uninstall them in the mod menu.
- For patch mods, open the "patch mods" folder in the mod menu and delete files manually.

## Why do I have to restart my game to save my changes?
Realm will force you to restart the game when you have patch mods installed or when an error occurs.
