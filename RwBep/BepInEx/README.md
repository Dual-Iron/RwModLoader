This file explains the contents of the BepInEx directory.

You can:
- put MonoMod patches, BepInEx plugins, and Partiality mods in `plugins`,
- delete MonoMod patches from `monomod`,
- modify how Realm behaves using files in `config` (beware modifying `BepInEx.cfg` though),
- leave `cache`, `core`, `patchers`, and `realm` alone,
- read game logs using `LogOutput.log`, and
- finish reading `README.md` now :)
